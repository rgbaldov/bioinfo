## 📘 Course Description
Biomedical Informatics explores the acquisition, representation, integration, analysis, and interpretation of **biomedical and health data** to support clinical and research decision-making. Topics include electronic health records (EHR), clinical data standards, data quality, predictive modeling, machine learning, and visualization in health contexts.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes  
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
- Describe fundamental concepts in biomedical and health informatics  
- Work with clinical and biomedical datasets (EHR, omics, imaging metadata)  
- Apply preprocessing, cleaning, and integration pipelines for real-world health data  
- Perform exploratory data analysis and visualization for clinical insights  
- Build and evaluate predictive models using machine learning  
- Understand ethical, privacy, and regulatory considerations in health data science
